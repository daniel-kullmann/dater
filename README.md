# Application using Django and Vue.js

This is an application for getting appointments for small businesses like
hair stylists. 

## Main concepts

* providers provide some service that customers an get appointments for
* the appointments are split into slots, so e.g. 9:15, 9:30, 9:45
* providers can have several available slots with different lengths



## How to represent available slots?

* Who is the owner of an available slot? The client or the provider?
  It could also be a location; when those are more limited than providers
  This depends on how the business works
